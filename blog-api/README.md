# Following a YouTube tutorial (Blog API)

This is my DjangoRest project which I am making for practice sake and learning<br>
I am making the project simultaneously as the videos progresses. <br>
I am pretty confident with CRUD and using python shell for the same and serializing data and objects and customizing permissions.<br>
I have pushed the current folder and will add as I progress with the videos.<br>

Here's the screenshots:
